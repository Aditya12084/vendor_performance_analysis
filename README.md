# **Vendor Performance Analysis**

**SQL • Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) • Power BI • Excel**

---

## **Project Overview**

This project analyzes vendor performance using procurement data to help businesses understand vendor contribution, cost drivers, and purchasing patterns. The analysis follows a structured data analytics workflow, from business problem definition to dashboard creation, using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

---

## **Business Problem**

Effective vendor and procurement management is critical for controlling costs and improving operational efficiency. Organizations often face challenges such as vendor dependency, high freight costs, and uneven vendor contribution.
The objective of this project is to evaluate vendor performance based on purchase value, freight cost, and order volume to support better procurement decision-making.

## **Project Flow**

1. Understanding the business problem
2. Exploring and cleaning data using SQL
3. Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python
4. Building an interactive Power BI dashboard
5. Reporting insights for decision support

---

## **SQL Data Analysis & Cleaning**

* Explored procurement and invoice-related tables using SQL
* Cleaned and merged multiple tables
* Created aggregated vendor-level datasets
* Analyzed key metrics such as:

  * Purchase value
  * Freight cost
  * Order quantity

---

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Conducted EDA using **Python (Pandas)** to understand vendor contribution and cost distribution
* Visualized insights using **Matplotlib and Seaborn**, including:

  * Purchase value distribution across vendors
  * Freight cost vs order quantity relationships
  * Top vendors contributing to procurement value
* Identified vendors with high costs and low contribution

---

## **Power BI Dashboard**

* Developed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to analyze vendor performance
![Dashboard](images/img.png)
* Dashboard highlights:

- Top Vendors & Brands: Visualizes top vendors by sales and top brands by revenue.

- Vendor Performance: Compares key metrics (sales, purchase, profit, profit margin, unsold capital) across vendors.

- Low Performing Analysis: Identifies low-performing vendors and brands.

- Interactive Filters: Enables dynamic exploration at vendor and brand level.

## **Tools & Technologies**

* **SQL** – Data extraction, joins, aggregation, and cleaning
* **Python** – Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for EDA
* **Power BI** – Dashboarding and KPI visualization

---

## **Key Insights**

* A small group of vendors contributes a significant portion of total purchase value
* Certain vendors incur disproportionately high freight costs
* Vendor performance varies significantly across cost and volume metrics

---

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow to evaluate vendor performance using SQL, Python, and Power BI. The insights help identify cost inefficiencies and support data-driven procurement decisions.

---

## **Future Enhancements**

* Add time-based trend analysis
* Automate data refresh in Power BI
* Extend analysis to vendor risk or cost anomaly detection
